                        <li>C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.
                            C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, and Java
                            programmers. C# is standardized by ECMA International as the <span id="sel">ECMA-334</span> standard and by
                            <span id="sel">ISO/IEC as the ISO/IEC 23270</span> standard. Microsoft's C# compiler for the
                            .NET Framework is a conforming implementation of both of these standards.
                        </li>
                        <li>C# is an object-oriented language, but C# further includes support for <span id="sel">component-oriented</span> programming.
                            Contemporary software design increasingly relies on software components in the form of self-contained
                            and self-describing packages of functionality. Key to such components is that they present a programming
                            model with properties, methods, and events; they have attributes that provide declarative information
                            about the component; and they incorporate their own documentation. C# provides language constructs
                            to directly support these concepts, making C# a very natural language in which to create and use
                            software components.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Several C# features aid in the construction of robust and durable applications:
                            <span id="sel">Garbage collection</span> automatically reclaims memory occupied by unused objects;
                            <span id="sel">exception handling</span> provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery;
                            and the <span id="sel">type-safe</span> design of the language makes it impossible to read from uninitialized variables,
                            to index arrays beyond their bounds, or to perform unchecked type casts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C# has a <span id="sel">unified type system</span>. All C# types, including primitive types such as <code id="marked">int</code> and <code id="marked">double</code>,
                            inherit from a single root <code id="marked">objects</code> type. Thus, all types share a set of common operations,
                            and values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner.
                            Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types, allowing dynamic
                            allocation of objects as well as in-line storage of lightweight structures.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To ensure that C# programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner,
                            much emphasis has been placed on <span id="sel">versioning</span> in C#'s design. Many programming languages pay
                            little attention to this issue, and, as a result, programs written in those languages break
                            more often than necessary when newer versions of dependent libraries are introduced. Aspects of C#'s
                            design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate <code id="marked">virtual</code> and
                            <code id="marked">override</code> modifiers, the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface
                            member declarations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The rest of this chapter describes the essential features of the C# language.
                            Although later chapters describe rules and exceptions in a detail-oriented and sometimes
                            mathematical manner, this chapter strives for clarity and brevity at the expense of completeness.
                            The intent is to provide the reader with an introduction to the language that will facilitate
                            the writing of early programs and the reading of later chapters.

                        <p>
                            The "Hello, World" program starts with a <code id="marked">using</code> directive that references the <code id="marked">System</code> namespace.
                            Namespaces provide a hierarchical means of organizing C# programs and libraries.
                            Namespaces contain types and other namespaces—for example, the System , namespace contains
                            a number of types, such as the <code id="marked">Console</code> class referenced in the program, and a number of other
                            namespacessuch as <code id="marked">IO</code> and <code id="marked">Collections</code>. A <code id="marked">using</code> directive that references a
                            given namespace enables unqualified use of the types that are members of that namespace.
                            Because of the <code id="marked">using</code> directive, the program can use <code id="marked">Console.WriteLine</code> as shorthand for
                            <code id="marked">System.Console.WriteLine</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <code id="marked">Hello</code> class declared by the "Hello, World" program has a single member, the method named <code id="marked">Mai</code>n.
                            The <code id="marked">Main</code> method is declared with the <code id="marked">static</code> modifier. While instance methods can reference a
                            particular enclosing object instance using the keyword <code id="marked">this</code>, static methods operate without
                            reference to a particular object. By convention, a static method named <code id="marked">Main</code> serves as the
                            entry point of a program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The output of the program is produced by the <code id="marked">WriteLine</code> method of the
                            <code id="marked">Console</code> class in the <code id="marked">System</code>
                            namespace. This class is provided by the .NET Framework class libraries, which, by default,
                            are automatically referenced by the Microsoft C# compiler. Note that C# itself does not have
                            a separate runtime library. Instead, the .NET Framework is the runtime library of C#.

                        <p>The key organizational concepts in C# are <span id="sel">programs</span>, <span id="sel">namespaces</span>,
                            <span id="sel">types</span>, <span id="sel">members</span>,and <span id="sel">assemblies</span>.
                            C# programs consist of one or more source files. Programs declare types,
                            which contain members and can be organized into namespaces. Classes and interfaces
                            are examples of types. Fields, methods, properties, and events are examples of members.
                            When C# programs are compiled, they are physically packaged into assemblies.
                            Assemblies typically have the file extension <code id="marked">.exe</code> or 
                            <code id="marked">.dll</code>, depending on whether they implement <span id="sel">applications</span> or <span id="sel">libraries</span>.

                            C# permits the source text of a program to be stored in several source files. When a multi-file C# program is compiled, all of the source files are processed together, and the source files can freely reference each other—conceptually, it is as if all the source files were concatenated into one large file before being processed. Forward declarations are never needed in C# because, with very few exceptions, declaration order is insignificant. C# does not limit a source file to declaring only one public type nor does it require the name of the source file to match a type declared in the source file.

                        <p>
                            There are two kinds of types in C#: <span id="sel">value types</span> and <span id="sel">reference types</span>.
                            Variables of value types directly contain their data whereas variables
                            of reference types store references to their data, the latter being known 
                            as objects. With reference types, it is possible for two variables to 
                            reference the same object and thus possible for operations on one variable 
                            to affect the object referenced by the other variable. With value types, 
                            the variables each have their own copy of the data, and it is not possible 
                            for operations on one to affect the other 
                            (except in the case of <code id="marked">ref</code> and <code id="marked">out</code> parameter variables).
                        </p>
                        <p>C#'s value types are further divided into <span id="sel">simple types</span>, <span id="sel">enum types</span>, 
                            <span id="sel">struct types</span>, and nullable types, and C#'s reference types are further 
                            divided into <span id="sel">class types</span>, <span id="sel">interface types</span>, <span id="sel">array types</span>, and <span id="sel">delegate types</span>.

                                C# programs use <span id="sel">type declarations</span> to create new types.
                                A type declaration specifies the name and the members of the new type.
                                Five of C#'s categories of types are user-definable: class types,
                                struct types, interface types, enum types, and delegate types.
                            </p>
                            <p>A class type defines a data structure that contains data members (fields) and function members (methods, properties, and others). Class types support single inheritance and polymorphism, mechanisms whereby derived classes can extend and specialize base classes.</p>
                            <p>
                                A struct type is similar to a class type in that it represents a structure with data members
                                and function members. However, unlike classes, structs are value types and do not require heap 
                                allocation. Struct types do not support user-specified inheritance, and all struct types implicitly 
                                inherit from type <code id="marked">object</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>An interface type defines a contract as a named set of public function members. A class or struct that implements an interface must provide implementations of the interface's function members. An interface may inherit from multiple base interfaces, and a class or struct may implement multiple interfaces.</p>
                            <p>A delegate type represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. Delegates make it possible to treat methods as entities that can be assigned to variables and passed as parameters. Delegates are similar to the concept of function pointers found in some other languages, but unlike function pointers, delegates are object-oriented and type-safe.</p>
                            <p>Class, struct, interface and delegate types all support generics, whereby they can be parameterized with other types.</p>
                            <p>An enum type is a distinct type with named constants. Every enum type has an underlying type, which must be one of the eight integral types. The set of values of an enum type is the same as the set of values of the underlying type.</p>
                            <p>
                                C# supports single- and multi-dimensional arrays of any type. 
                                Unlike the types listed above, array types do not have to be 
                                declared before they can be used. Instead, array types are 
                                constructed by following a type name with square brackets. 
                                For example, <code id="marked">int[]</code> is a single-dimensional array of <code id="marked">int</code>, 
                                <code id="marked">int[,]</code> is a two-dimensional array of <code id="marked">int</code>, and <code id="marked">int[][]</code> is a single-dimensional 
                                array of single-dimensional arrays of <code id="marked">int</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nullable types also do not have to be declared before they can be used. 
                                For each non-nullable value type <code id="marked">T</code> there is a corresponding nullable type <code id="marked">T?</code>, 
                                which can hold an additional value <code id="marked">null</code>. For instance, <code id="marked">int?</code> is a 
                                type that can hold any 32 bit integer or the value <code id="marked">null</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>C#'s type system is unified such that a value of any type can be treated as an object. 
                                Every type in C# directly or indirectly derives from the <code id="marked">object </code>class type, 
                                and <code id="marked">object</code> is the ultimate base class of all types. Values of reference 
                                types are treated as objects simply by viewing the values as type object. 
                                Values of value types are treated as <code id="marked">objects</code> by performing <span id="sel">boxing</span> and 
                                <span id="sel">unboxing</span> operations. In the following example, an int value is converted 
                                to <code id="marked">object</code>and back again to <code id="marked">int</code>.
                            </p>

                            <p>When a value of a value type is converted to type <code id="marked">object</code>, an object instance, 
                                also called a "box," is allocated to hold the value, and the value is 
                                copied into that box. Conversely, when an <code id="marked">object</code> reference is cast to 
                                a value type, a check is made that the referenced object is a box of 
                                the correct value type, and, if the check succeeds, the value in the box is copied out.

                                C#'s unified type system effectively means that value types can become objects "on demand."
                                 Because of the unification, general-purpose libraries that use type <code id="marked">object</code> can be used
                                  with both reference types and value types.

                                There are several kinds of <span id="sel">variables</span> in C#, including fields, array elements,
                                local variables, and parameters. Variables represent storage locations,
                                and every variable has a type that determines what values can be stored
                                in the variable, as shown by the following table.

                        <p>
                            Expressions are constructed from operands and operators. The operators of an expression indicate
                             which operations to apply to the operands. Examples of operators include +, -, *, /,
                            and new. Examples of operands include literals, fields, local variables, and expressions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When an expression contains multiple operators, the precedence of the operators 
                            controls the order in which the individual operators are evaluated. 
                            For example, the expression x + y * z is evaluated as x + (y * z) because the 
                            * operator has higher precedence than the + operator.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most operators can be overloaded. Operator overloading permits user-defined operator 
                            implementations to be specified for operations where one or both of the operands 
                            are of a user-defined class or struct type.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The following table summarizes C#'s operators, listing the operator categories 
                            in order of precedence from highest to lowest. Operators in the same category have equal precedence.
